## C++ Programming Lab Solutions - Economic Informatics
This repository contains a series of C++ implementations developed as part of the curriculum for the Economic Informatics (Informatică Economică) specialization at the University of Craiova.

The projects focus on fundamental algorithms, data structure optimization (such as sparse matrices and polynomials), and generic programming techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure
Problema 1: Sparse Matrix management using triplet representation and efficient memory allocation.

Problema 2: String matrix processing, including sorting verification and pattern recognition.

Problema 3: Matrix transformation utility for dynamic row and column removal.

Problema 4: Polynomial calculus engine (evaluation, derivatives, and formatted display).

Problema 6: Implementation of a generic Insertion Sort algorithm using void* and function pointers.

## 🚀 How to Run
Each file is a standalone C++ program. To compile and run any of these files, follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++ or clang).

Compilation: Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
g++ FileName.cpp -o OutputName
